# READY!OS
**READY!OS** - The official software repository of **READY! Computer Corporation**

# Description:
**READY!OS** is a collection of FREE and OPEN SOURCE software either modified for specialised use or simply included as recommended software with the **READY! MODEL 100** portable computer kit. **READY!OS** is not a singular 'product' but a curated repository of various FOSS software packages and **READY!** related information and documentation.

# Purpose:
**READY! Computer Corporation** has assembled **READY!OS** with no intent on sale or assertion of ownership rights. We believe the included software compliments the **READY! MODEL 100** both in meeting the needs of the form-factor and the philosophical spirit that drives **READY!** which strongly supports and believes in the power of _FREE and OPEN SOURCE software._

# Objectives:
We hope this software will help show you what an incredible tool a portable computer can be, the benefits of programming, and an appreciation for FREE and OPEN source software. We also hope the use of this repository will help you better put your **READY! MODEL 100** to good use.

# Systems Supported: (as of November 2021)
ARM64 and AMD64 are the primary platforms READY! Computer Corporation has focused this repository around given our expectation of R!100 users operating with a Raspberry Pi or an AMD Ryzen SBC. Despite this, the repository is not a collection of precompiled binaries and is in theory suitable for any operating system capable of compiling the appropriate codebases. That said, we strongly support * NIX style operating systems *(FreeBSD, Linux, etc)* as a fundamental operating system layer for maximum compatibility with our curated repository.

# Licencing:
The licencing for each codebase is dependent on the original licence by the original authors of each piece of software. **READY!** asserts no ownership over any code where it has no right to do so. Please review the licence file included in each folder for further information about the licencing for each software codebase included in READY!OS
